Extended Kalman Filter Calibration and Localization: EKF-CAL is a package focused on the simulation
and development of a multi-sensor online calibration kalman filter. It combines the architecture of
a Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF) with a multi-IMU calibration filter to provide
estimates of intrinsic and extrinsic sensor calibration parameters.
